# flip7

Flip 7 is a card game with the aim of gaining 200 or more points before other players. 

In a round, players hit (gain a card) or stay (stop and gain points). They bust and gain no points if they get a duplicate number card.

This project is a card counter designed to tell a player their chance to bust based off their current hand and the remaining cards in the deck.
